				<h2> NATURE IN THE GLASS</h2>
				<p>Natural scenery changes daily and show us many expres-sions. I’m always moved by expressions and atmospheres of nature I unexpectedly come across. The natural stone arrangements I see in the mountain streams, the way moss grows, and a scene with fallen driftwood are typical examples. And they give us specific tips for layouts. When I think about why I am so attracted by such scenes, I realize that it’s simply because those landscapes are created by a huge amount of time. Although the time scale is different, the natural feeling and elegance is created by the long-term maintenance in Nature Aquarium. I try to cherish such effortless expressions too.</p>

				<h2> GREEN ALGAE</h2>
				<p>When you keep fish, sooner or later you will have to deal with algae. So anyone with goldfish should know how to address different kinds of alga, whether you keep your goldfish in an aquarium or in a pond. Fortunately, managing algae is not impossible.
					<br>
					Alga is not always a bad thing. For example, goldfish need some green algae in their diet and may nibble at algae in their habitat. Feeding them algae flakes every now and then is good for them. Spirulina is a blue-green alga that is found both in goldfish food and often is an ingredient in health food products for humans.
					<br>
					There are several common types of alga you're likely to encounter. Green algae tend to occur in stringy strands (filaments) or as free-floating cells. When it is free-floating, green alga looks like green water. Blue-green algae are a bluish-green slime and are more of a concern than green algae, as they can be poisonous to fish and very few things eat it. Brown algae occur in sheets on aquarium surfaces.</p>

				<h2> JAPANESE BIOTOPE AQUARIUM</h2>
				<p>The styles above often combine plant and animal species based on the desired visual impact, without regard to geographic origin. Biotope aquariums are designed instead to replicate exactly a particular aquatic habitat at a particular geographic location, and not necessarily to provide a gardenlike display. Plants and fish need not be present at all, but if they are, they must match what would be found in nature in the habitat being represented, as must any gravel and hardscape, and even the chemical composition of the water. By including only those organisms that naturally exist together, biotopes can be used to study ecological interactions in a relatively natural setting.</p>
